Notes:
Variables declared with const added becomes constants and cannot be altered by the program.
Declaration: put const either before or after the type. Eg: int const x=5; or const int x=4;
In the above eg., we are only making data referred to const and references cannot change what they refer to.
Pointers have 2 ways that we can use:
- change the date pointed to.
- change the pointer itself.
