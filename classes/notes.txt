- Class declaration defines a new type that links code and data. This new types
  is then used to declare objects of that class.
- A class is a logical abstraction, but an object has physical existence. or an
  object is an instance of a class.
- "public" access specifier allows functions or data to be accessible to other
  parts of program.
- "protected" access specifier is needed only when inheritance is involved.
- "private" access specifier: by default, functions and data declared within a
  class are private to that class and may be accessed only by other members of
  the class.
